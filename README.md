Weather API
============

Last week I had a job interview and bascially the company wanted me to build this weather api. I was unable to complete the task in their offices in the alloted time,  so I decided to build this online to practice. 

Basically I was getting stuck on the XML and JSon parsing. I was a bit rusty but I feel a lot more confident now. 

This is the first of many little projects taht I will be buildling. Just thought I would throw it up here. 

Any who back to coding
