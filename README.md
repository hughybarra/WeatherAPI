Weather API
============

Last week I had a job interview and bascially they wanted me to build this. I was unable to complete the task in their office so I decided to build this online to practice. 

Basically I was getting stuck on the XML and JSon parsing. I was a bit rusty but I feel a lot more confident now. 

This is the first of many little projects taht I will be buildling. Just thought I would throw it up here. 

Any who back to coding
